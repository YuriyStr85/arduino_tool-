Help on method bind in module tkinter:

bind(sequence=None, func=None, add=None) method of tkinter.Tk instance
    Bind to this widget at event SEQUENCE a call to function FUNC.
    
    SEQUENCE is a string of concatenated event
    patterns. An event pattern is of the form
    <MODIFIER-MODIFIER-TYPE-DETAIL> where MODIFIER is one
    of Control, Mod2, M2, Shift, Mod3, M3, Lock, Mod4, M4,
    Button1, B1, Mod5, M5 Button2, B2, Meta, M, Button3,
    B3, Alt, Button4, B4, Double, Button5, B5 Triple,
    Mod1, M1. TYPE is one of Activate, Enter, Map,
    ButtonPress, Button, Expose, Motion, ButtonRelease
    FocusIn, MouseWheel, Circulate, FocusOut, Property,
    Colormap, Gravity Reparent, Configure, KeyPress, Key,
    Unmap, Deactivate, KeyRelease Visibility, Destroy,
    Leave and DETAIL is the button number for ButtonPress,
    ButtonRelease and DETAIL is the Keysym for KeyPress and
    KeyRelease. Examples are
    <Control-Button-1> for pressing Control and mouse button 1 or
    <Alt-A> for pressing A and the Alt key (KeyPress can be omitted).
    An event pattern can also be a virtual event of the form
    <<AString>> where AString can be arbitrary. This
    event can be generated by event_generate.
    If events are concatenated they must appear shortly
    after each other.
    
    FUNC will be called if the event sequence occurs with an
    instance of Event as argument. If the return value of FUNC is
    "break" no further bound function is invoked.
    
    An additional boolean parameter ADD specifies whether FUNC will
    be called additionally to the other bound function or whether
    it will replace the previous function.
    
    Bind will return an identifier to allow deletion of the bound function with
    unbind without memory leak.
    
    If FUNC or SEQUENCE is omitted the bound function or list
    of bound events are returned.
